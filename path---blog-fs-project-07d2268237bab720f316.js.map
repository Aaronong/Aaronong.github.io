Market Need</h4>\\n<p>SMEs continue to display a strong need for two financial products/services:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<p>They require tools to facilitate their financial planning.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>They require short-term loans during low working capital cycles.</p>\\n<p>​</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Our product is well-positioned to target these market needs.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>While the market is fairly saturated with products/services that provide\\neither of the above-mentioned services, there is currently no solution that\\n<strong>integrates both services</strong> on a single platform.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The platform offers the functionality to detect <strong>low working capital\\ncycles</strong>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>The platform will complement Funding Societies's current unique selling point\\n(incredibly simplified and expedited capital funding)</p>\\n<p>​</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>c. Market Competition</h4>\\n<p><code>Xero and Quickbooks</code></p>\\n<p>For <strong>financial planning tools</strong>, Xero and Quickbooks are the forerunners in the\\nSingaporean market. While Quickbooks is a global leader in the financial\\nplanning SaaS space, and Xero is gaining traction in Singapore due to their deep\\nintegration with local banks.</p>\\n<p>Xero is the only financial planning tool available in the market that has\\nsuccessfully integrated with DBS's SME banking backend. They are also intending\\nto integrate with all 5 major Singapore-based SME banks in the coming year.\\nHence, Xero is able to receive bank feeds of their customers' corporate\\nfinancial data and do not require repeated 2FA verifications to refresh\\nfinancial data.</p>\\n<p>As DBS is the market leader in the SME banking space, Xero's DBS integration\\nmakes it the most convenient, secure, and therefore most naturally desirable SME\\nfinancial planning tool in Singapore. Both Quickbooks and Xero are able to\\nscrape financial data from personal bank accounts; neither has integrated with\\nOCBC, UOB, Standard Chartered, or HSBC SME banking accounts.</p>\\n<p><code>Seedly</code></p>\\n<p>Seedly is an indirect competitor in the financial planning tools market. Like\\nQuickbooks and Xero, they offer scraping of financial data from personal bank\\naccounts, but they are postured mainly as a personal finance planning\\napplication. They offer no integration with corporate bank accounts. Corporate\\naccounts aside, Seedly's simple UI, focused feature set, and free software model\\nhas attracted a large following. They are likely to be a viable threat should\\nthey venture into the SME market.</p>\\n<p><code>MoolahSense</code></p>\\n<p>For <strong>short-term working capital loans</strong>, MoolahSense is a direct competitor in\\nthe P2P lending space while SmartFunding.sg, and FundedHere are indirect\\ncompetitors. None of our competitors in this space have developed any form of\\nfinancial planning tools to complement their services.</p>\\n<h2>3. Proposed Solution</h2>\\n<h4>a. Product Positioning</h4>\\n<p>A key value proposition of our new product is the ability to aggregate financial\\ninformation across corporate and personal bank accounts. Due to the dominance\\ncurrently established by Xero in this area, we have to position/brand our\\nproduct not as a financial accounting tool but as a financial tool catered\\ntowards managing and acquiring liquidity.</p>\\n<h4>b. Feature Set</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Aggregate corporate financial data (Account Balance, Inflows, and Outflows)</li>\\n<li>Aggregate personal financial data (Account Balance, Inflows, and Outflows)</li>\\n<li>Offer basic accounting ratios (focus on liquidity ratios)</li>\\n<li>Offer basic budget setting and tracking (A feature I found useful on Seedly)</li>\\n<li>Visualise financial data</li>\\n<li>Predict period of low working capital</li>\\n<li>Recommend loan quantum and duration</li>\\n<li>Integrate FS Bolt</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>4. Challenges and Recommendations</h2>\\n<p>This section outlines the main challenges that have been considered along with\\nrecommendations to overcome them where applicable.</p>\\n<h4>a. Market Challenges</h4>\\n<p>The main market challenge is to break the dominance that Xero has on the market.\\nTheir plans to integrate bank feeds with all major SME banks in Singapore will\\nonly further propagate their market dominance in the coming years.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>The product should be positioned as a financial tool <strong>catered towards managing\\nand acquiring working capital</strong>. Within the Singapore market, Funding Societies\\nis best positioned to address this problem. Tools such as this are absent in\\nSingapore's market and we will have the first-mover's advantage.</p>\\n<p>However, while such a product will help our customers to acquire working capital\\nthrough loans disbursed by Funding Societies, offering loans alone will not make\\nus indispensible as a liquidity acquisition tool. Customers will be best served\\nif we partner with some of our indirect competitors in the market to <strong>increase\\nexposure and access to other means of acquiring liquidity</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>SmartFunding.sg</strong> will allow customers to acquire working capital through\\nselling their invoices. As there is a limited amount of working capital that our\\ncustomers can generate through this method, partnering with SmartFunding.sg is\\nunlikely to significantly affect the volume of loan requests Funding Societies\\nreceives.</p>\\n<p><strong>CardUp</strong> is branded as a solution that allows its customers to earn more\\nmiles, cashback, and rebates through enabling payments through the credit line.\\nA partnership with CardUp will allow customers to acquire working capital\\nthrough fulfilling their payments using their credit line. As credit lines\\ngenerally demand higher interest rates, our customers are unlikely to obtain\\nworking capital through credit lines for loans beyond one to two months.</p>\\n<p>While these partnerships would drive down the average loan quantum Funding\\nSocieties disburses per customer, the partnership is likely drive up the total\\nloan quantum disbursed through reaching out to a wider market. While our largest\\nthreat in the financial planning domain is Xero and Quickbooks, it may be wise\\nto partner with some of these smaller players to upset their dominance.</p>\\n<h4>b. Legal and Security Challenges</h4>\\n<p>MAS regulates financial data very stringently, thus we will need to demonstrate\\nthat we are managing our customers' financial data with the utmost care to gain\\nthe trust of the public and institutions.</p>\\n<p>Legal liability is another potential issue. Since our services will only obtain\\nread-only access to our customers' bank accounts, our liability is limited to\\nmishandling our clients' financial data. I am currently unsure of how much\\nproduct owners will be liable for if this scenario occurs and I require Funding\\nSocieties's advice on this front.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>Our legal challenges are primarily rooted in our product's security.\\nImplementing the following security features well will help us remain compliant:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Provide a secure third-party authentication model</li>\\n<li>Manage our customers' access permissions stringently</li>\\n<li>Manage our backend and database security stringently</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>c. Secure 3rd Party Authentication</h4>\\n<p>There are two 3rd party authentication models I am currently considering.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The first is to act as the middleman when performing authentication. Our\\nclients input their credentials on our platform and we authenticate on their\\nbehalf.</li>\\n<li>The second is to redirect our clients to their bank site, and obtain the\\nauthentication token/handler from the bank site.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>While the first option gives our users a more native experience on mobile\\nplatforms, the second is preferred from a security standpoint. Popular 3rd party\\nauthentication solutions such as Facebook, and Google all employ the second\\nmodel. The second model is also likely to be more compliant with MAS's\\nregulations, and customers are more likely to trust us if we use this approach.</p>\\n<h4>d. Selecting our Financial Aggregation Method</h4>\\n<p>First and foremost, we need to disambiguate between corporate financial data and\\npersonal financial data.</p>\\n<p><code>Personal financial data</code></p>\\n<p>While there are financial data aggregation APIs available in the personal\\nbanking space, <strong>no equivalent is available in the corporate banking space</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Two personal banking API services have been well-tested within Singapore. The\\nfirst being <strong>SaltEdge</strong>, the API service employed by Seedly. It is extremely\\nreliable and easy to use, but comes at a price of $500/month, hardly affordable\\nin my opinion.</p>\\n<p>The second is <strong>Yodlee</strong>, the API service employed by Xero. I have encountered a\\nsingle report regarding Xero not being able to connect to a DBS savings plus\\naccount, but I believe this to be an isolated incident as there was no\\nfollow-up. Yodlee's api service is thus just as reliable as SaltEdge's but comes\\nat only $250/month.</p>\\n<p>Both API services provide additional features such as transaction categorization\\nand takes the hassle out of maintaining our own web scraper. We need to discuss\\nif we wish to employ an API service for our personal financial data aggregation\\nor build our own web scrapers. This decision also depends heavily upon the types\\nof information that we hope to obtain.</p>\\n<p><code>Corporate financial data</code></p>\\n<p>There are currently two options available to us for obtaining corporate\\nfinancial data.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Build our own web scrapers</li>\\n<li>Build our platform on top of Xero's API (this will limit our market to\\nindividuals who are already on the Xero platform, so I believe this to be an\\nnon-option)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Another possible solution is to work with Moneythor on delivering an API\\nservice. The issue is - I have no visibility into the APIs that they offer. I\\nhave also contacted Moneythor to request for permission to use their API\\nservices, they have, however, denied my request.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>I propose that we start with building web scrapers for the SME banking portals.\\nThen, depending upon the perceived trade-offs in cost and development hours,\\ndecide between using scraping APIs or develop our own web scrapers for personal\\nbanking portals.</p>\\n<p>Scraping APIs are likely to be more reliable, trusted, updated, and might also\\nlead to a lower maintenance cost. A drawback of using scraping APIs is that we\\nare not able to authenticate our clients using the redirection method.</p>\\n<h4>e. Maintaining Web scrapers</h4>\\n<p>If we develop in-house web scrapers, there will be the additional costs to\\nensure that they remain updated.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>Proper unit testing mechanisms and heartbeat algorithms will need to be\\ndeveloped to detect for downtime.</p>\\n<h4>f. Using Bank Feeds</h4>\\n<p>An alternative to developing and maintaining our web-scrapers is to obtain\\npermission from the banks to use their bank feed APIs. Since Xero has already\\nset the precedence for using bank feed APIs, it should be relatively easier to\\nconvince the banks to allow us to use their Bank Feed APIs.</p>\\n<p>Banks also wish to portray themselves as forward looking and supportive of\\ninnovation. But the convincing will be difficult from my end alone since banks\\nare unlikely to trust an unestablished and inexperienced individual such as\\nmyself.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>Building the webscrapers first and gaining a user base should be prioritized\\nbefore approaching the banks to integrate their bank feeds. As most bank feeds\\nare currently still unavailable, this is not likely to be a viable option for\\nthe coming year.</p>\\n<h2>5.

Due to the dominance\\ncurrently established by Xero in this area, we have to position/brand our\\nproduct not as a financial accounting tool but as a financial tool catered\\ntowards managing and acquiring liquidity.</p>\\n<h4>b. Feature Set</h4>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Aggregate corporate financial data (Account Balance, Inflows, and Outflows)</li>\\n<li>Aggregate personal financial data (Account Balance, Inflows, and Outflows)</li>\\n<li>Offer basic accounting ratios (focus on liquidity ratios)</li>\\n<li>Offer basic budget setting and tracking (A feature I found useful on Seedly)</li>\\n<li>Visualise financial data</li>\\n<li>Predict period of low working capital</li>\\n<li>Recommend loan quantum and duration</li>\\n<li>Integrate FS Bolt</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>4. Challenges and Recommendations</h2>\\n<p>This section outlines the main challenges that have been considered along with\\nrecommendations to overcome them where applicable.</p>\\n<h4>a. Market Challenges</h4>\\n<p>The main market challenge is to break the dominance that Xero has on the market.\\nTheir plans to integrate bank feeds with all major SME banks in Singapore will\\nonly further propagate their market dominance in the coming years.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>The product should be positioned as a financial tool <strong>catered towards managing\\nand acquiring working capital</strong>. Within the Singapore market, Funding Societies\\nis best positioned to address this problem. Tools such as this are absent in\\nSingapore's market and we will have the first-mover's advantage.</p>\\n<p>However, while such a product will help our customers to acquire working capital\\nthrough loans disbursed by Funding Societies, offering loans alone will not make\\nus indispensible as a liquidity acquisition tool. Customers will be best served\\nif we partner with some of our indirect competitors in the market to <strong>increase\\nexposure and access to other means of acquiring liquidity</strong>.</p>\\n<p><strong>SmartFunding.sg</strong> will allow customers to acquire working capital through\\nselling their invoices. As there is a limited amount of working capital that our\\ncustomers can generate through this method, partnering with SmartFunding.sg is\\nunlikely to significantly affect the volume of loan requests Funding Societies\\nreceives.</p>\\n<p><strong>CardUp</strong> is branded as a solution that allows its customers to earn more\\nmiles, cashback, and rebates through enabling payments through the credit line.\\nA partnership with CardUp will allow customers to acquire working capital\\nthrough fulfilling their payments using their credit line. As credit lines\\ngenerally demand higher interest rates, our customers are unlikely to obtain\\nworking capital through credit lines for loans beyond one to two months.</p>\\n<p>While these partnerships would drive down the average loan quantum Funding\\nSocieties disburses per customer, the partnership is likely drive up the total\\nloan quantum disbursed through reaching out to a wider market. While our largest\\nthreat in the financial planning domain is Xero and Quickbooks, it may be wise\\nto partner with some of these smaller players to upset their dominance.</p>\\n<h4>b. Legal and Security Challenges</h4>\\n<p>MAS regulates financial data very stringently, thus we will need to demonstrate\\nthat we are managing our customers' financial data with the utmost care to gain\\nthe trust of the public and institutions.</p>\\n<p>Legal liability is another potential issue. Since our services will only obtain\\nread-only access to our customers' bank accounts, our liability is limited to\\nmishandling our clients' financial data. I am currently unsure of how much\\nproduct owners will be liable for if this scenario occurs and I require Funding\\nSocieties's advice on this front.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>Our legal challenges are primarily rooted in our product's security.\\nImplementing the following security features well will help us remain compliant:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Provide a secure third-party authentication model</li>\\n<li>Manage our customers' access permissions stringently</li>\\n<li>Manage our backend and database security stringently</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>c. Secure 3rd Party Authentication</h4>\\n<p>There are two 3rd party authentication models I am currently considering.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The first is to act as the middleman when performing authentication. Our\\nclients input their credentials on our platform and we authenticate on their\\nbehalf.</li>\\n<li>The second is to redirect our clients to their bank site, and obtain the\\nauthentication token/handler from the bank site.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>While the first option gives our users a more native experience on mobile\\nplatforms, the second is preferred from a security standpoint. Popular 3rd party\\nauthentication solutions such as Facebook, and Google all employ the second\\nmodel. The second model is also likely to be more compliant with MAS's\\nregulations, and customers are more likely to trust us if we use this approach.</p>\\n<h4>d. Selecting our Financial Aggregation Method</h4>\\n<p>First and foremost, we need to disambiguate between corporate financial data and\\npersonal financial data.</p>\\n<p><code>Personal financial data</code></p>\\n<p>While there are financial data aggregation APIs available in the personal\\nbanking space, <strong>no equivalent is available in the corporate banking space</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Two personal banking API services have been well-tested within Singapore. The\\nfirst being <strong>SaltEdge</strong>, the API service employed by Seedly. It is extremely\\nreliable and easy to use, but comes at a price of $500/month, hardly affordable\\nin my opinion.</p>\\n<p>The second is <strong>Yodlee</strong>, the API service employed by Xero. I have encountered a\\nsingle report regarding Xero not being able to connect to a DBS savings plus\\naccount, but I believe this to be an isolated incident as there was no\\nfollow-up. Yodlee's api service is thus just as reliable as SaltEdge's but comes\\nat only $250/month.</p>\\n<p>Both API services provide additional features such as transaction categorization\\nand takes the hassle out of maintaining our own web scraper. We need to discuss\\nif we wish to employ an API service for our personal financial data aggregation\\nor build our own web scrapers. This decision also depends heavily upon the types\\nof information that we hope to obtain.</p>\\n<p><code>Corporate financial data</code></p>\\n<p>There are currently two options available to us for obtaining corporate\\nfinancial data.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Build our own web scrapers</li>\\n<li>Build our platform on top of Xero's API (this will limit our market to\\nindividuals who are already on the Xero platform, so I believe this to be an\\nnon-option)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Another possible solution is to work with Moneythor on delivering an API\\nservice. The issue is - I have no visibility into the APIs that they offer. I\\nhave also contacted Moneythor to request for permission to use their API\\nservices, they have, however, denied my request.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>I propose that we start with building web scrapers for the SME banking portals.\\nThen, depending upon the perceived trade-offs in cost and development hours,\\ndecide between using scraping APIs or develop our own web scrapers for personal\\nbanking portals.</p>\\n<p>Scraping APIs are likely to be more reliable, trusted, updated, and might also\\nlead to a lower maintenance cost. A drawback of using scraping APIs is that we\\nare not able to authenticate our clients using the redirection method.</p>\\n<h4>e. Maintaining Web scrapers</h4>\\n<p>If we develop in-house web scrapers, there will be the additional costs to\\nensure that they remain updated.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>Proper unit testing mechanisms and heartbeat algorithms will need to be\\ndeveloped to detect for downtime.</p>\\n<h4>f. Using Bank Feeds</h4>\\n<p>An alternative to developing and maintaining our web-scrapers is to obtain\\npermission from the banks to use their bank feed APIs. Since Xero has already\\nset the precedence for using bank feed APIs, it should be relatively easier to\\nconvince the banks to allow us to use their Bank Feed APIs.</p>\\n<p>Banks also wish to portray themselves as forward looking and supportive of\\ninnovation. But the convincing will be difficult from my end alone since banks\\nare unlikely to trust an unestablished and inexperienced individual such as\\nmyself.</p>\\n<p><code>Recommendations</code></p>\\n<p>Building the webscrapers first and gaining a user base should be prioritized\\nbefore approaching the banks to integrate their bank feeds. As most bank feeds\\nare currently still unavailable, this is not likely to be a viable option for\\nthe coming year.</p>\\n<h2>5.

Closing Note</h2>\\n<p>I believe this product can demonstrate significant value, and with Singapore’s\\ngrowing support for the SME space, it will be only become more relevant as the\\nbarriers to entry for SMEs get increasingly lower.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"November 20, 2017\",\"path\":\"fsProject\",\"title\":\"Funding Societies Project\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"id\":\"fsProject\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/blog-fs-project.json\n// module id = 590\n// module chunks = 47233566966272"],"sourceRoot":""}
