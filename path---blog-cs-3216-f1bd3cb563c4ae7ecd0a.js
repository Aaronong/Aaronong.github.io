Having not taken\na single course outside of Yale-NUS before, I anticipate the class with a\nmixture of apprehension and excitement.</p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>For some background, I major in Mathematical, Computational, and Statistical\nSciences at Yale-NUS College. Yes, that is what my major is called, and while\nits breadth is enticing, we generally lack depth because we have to fulfill\nrequirements across all three disciplines. Couple that with the fact that\nYale-NUS Students are only required to take 10~12 modules within our major, you\nquickly arrive at a very diluted CS experience. Nonetheless, CS courses at\nYale-NUS are generally well-taught and rigourous. Our liberal arts curriculum\nalso trains us to think from multiple perspectives which I have found to be\nextremely useful when dealing with software development.</p>\n<p>I applied to the course as a Developer/Biz Dev. Some of the relevant web\ndevelopment experiences I have are in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frameworks: Django (Python), Express (Node.js), Gin (Golang), JavaEE (...)</li>\n<li>Frontend: Vanilla js, JQuery, React</li>\n<li>Databases: MariaDB, MS Sql Server, SQLite</li>\n<li>ORM: Django ORM (Python), Sequelize (Node.js), Xorm (Golang)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also spent a summer interning in a web penetration testing team, so I guess\nthat's relevant experience as well. Also, while I am capable of Frontend\ndevelopment, my design skills are horrendous so don't count on that. <strong>Yes,\nanyone who reads this post, please advice me on how I can make my site look\nbetter.</strong></p>\n<h3>Why I chose CS3216</h3>\n<p>CS3216 is more than just a class to me. (cliche) But seriously though, I chose\nto take this class because it provides me with the opportunity to work closely\nwith some of my brightest peers from the greater NUS community. Having not\nbroken out of the Yale-NUS bubble before, I am looking forward to the\nexperience. I have also heard great things of Colin and his teaching team, and I\nintend to make full use of my limited interactions with them.</p>\n<p>From a more technical perspective, I am intending to learn the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Develop business acumen: While I have attended multiple hackathons and\nbusiness case competitions before, these events are often too short for me to\ndevelop a deep understanding of how the different moving parts of a\nbusiness/product interplay to make the business/product successful.</li>\n<li>Design: It is my belief that good UI/UX is a strong predictive factor of a\nproduct's success. A robust system means nothing when you cannot convince\npeople to use it.</li>\n<li>Stickiness: What makes a product sticky? How do we convince new customers to\nuse our product? How do we keep our existing customers coming? Understanding\nthe nebulous concept of stickiness is tricky, and I hope to concretize my\nknowledge of it.</li>\n<li>Choosing Technology Stack: While this is generally a lesser concern for\nprojects that do not scale, I am hoping to learn how to make my tech stack\ndecisions beyond the basic criterias such as familiarity, fit, library\nsupport, documentation, and popularity.</li>\n<li>Full-Stack development: While I have listed a fairly long list of web\ntechnologies that I am familiar with, my engagement with each technology is\noften limited to only 1~2 projects. I hope to put in lots of development\nhours during this course to hone my skills. If time permits, I also hope to\nemploy CI in some of my projects.</li>\n<li>Mobile app development: I am a stranger to mobile app development and I hope\nto expose myself to it in this course.</li>\n<li>NoSQL: I read up on the CAP theorem a little and played with the mongo shell\na little, other than that, I know little about NoSQL.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To everyone reading this, I look forward to meeting each and every one of you :D</p>",frontmatter:{date:"August 09, 2017",path:"cs3216",title:"What I hope to learn in CS3216"}}},pathContext:{id:"cs3216"}}}});
