What\nwould we gain? or lose?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Office with parallel lines</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Think about a stereotypical office. Cubicles are stacked tightly next to one\nanother to create an organized grid. Could this structured and well-packed\nenvironment exist without parallel lines?</p>\n<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HYan2o2MeIEmSQPLDULjhPOquOtzgyMQDSLqXFKo39PyqLV1GO-Z2xYfv9mkChEe41ajCCRrcPqlbu9ftpzubVuCezfkTmMNT6fJUkIi7GTcaeWlD-FU7IP90Fotr5wRqiR1bY1Yxk4" alt="img"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Office without parallel lines</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How would offices change without parallel lines? To answer this question, I\ntried to sketch an office without parallel lines. To sketch this office, i drew\ninspiration from various places.</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Modern office</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First and foremost, I tried to draw inspiration from modern offices. Many modern\noffices incorporate curved, and circular geometrical objects into the\nenvironment. Doesn\'t it feel so much more laid-back, and homely compared to the\nstereotypical office? My drawing mainly drew inspiration from modern offices for\ninternal furnishing, however, as window panes and a multi-floored office\nbuilding neccessarily contains parallel lines, I decided to find another source\nof inspiration for the physical structure of the office.</p>\n<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Wa1oody6CDlnecFGw67heQ6w0CjkeRuwcBGLjGerAoPy1eHKI7Jh344PiuCaW9uhjjdi36c7NhgS1W7xwGqWvr3fudgQgqHb3rpTQTg5UP4P9XwACWhPQJu1yCjGaMSXo6QTI4CesFY" alt="img"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Yurt office</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I turned to the Mongolian Yurt (or Ger) for inspiration to draw the physical\nstructure of my office without parallel lines. However, while the physical\nstructure of the Yurt does not contain parallel lines, its frames are often\nbuilt by weaving lattices of parallel wood or bamboo strips together.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Mogolian Yurt</th>\n<th>Yurt frame</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sgv7CNqutmBBK56XpqRFsKPf7Z7oYAGzryk5hOMWscxSN6J45gJEiDdvEwzw7Dntz0MpGwLtgJzeQpKVRqNxkYvlD1ZDfoy9GIOsSz-8UJvMoIIy0SnE4rt3L0abktwRKSy7S2032oA" alt="img"></strong></td>\n<td><strong><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iJxQUyW3lxQ4W9cjzJ0ZTLAhaFcAor2j1FO-5Wgtxz5yPFalTVK00-r2sNs9CYjhECZTPSAuL6sFjhECx8LIXwmQDGHRKG3pKun5mOUeNiFDWdWMN2BjECXqQdJ6LyZCaoGxOeuVYog" alt="img"></strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The woven lattice was, however, not essential to the building of the Yurt\nstructure. This is demonstrated by the Yurt-inspired tent displayed below.\nHence, the Yurt structure was chosen to be the physical structure of my office\nwithout parallel lines.</p>\n<p><strong><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FXCgbitxuCijoQzddRlhGSNTeBfh4x5bGJBxwxCSmwg63ipba6MIVpCyTfh8r4hNOacvFlSx1IN7DM-F4U1i4g92s_Dj4i_r_-51__-1_J0_48t7FjRF0dCdd-fpAvaJlJUq0aiS4XE" alt="img"></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Tables and Chairs</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The table for my office was modelled after regular hardwood tables, but cut in a\nway that it does not contain any parallel lines.</p>\n<p><img src="https://img.etsystatic.com/il/af292f/1359311503/il_fullxfull.1359311503_j916.jpg?version=0"></p>\n<p>The chairs for my office are modelled after red-blood cell shaped bean-bags.</p>\n<p><strong><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/q2TtDpmBOOOoc05UiCLtyAmr5qpp-_wDcjootDvTtuAmmVE-y8_A2JtezeUyslrrd99o9GrbjXjCqRP-g4oqkmOrHlSpfcLqKurobz1IsY7tUri464_p0dCpcFSBdnKxGZxnAE10a8s" alt="img"></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Laptop</h2>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The laptop that I drew was inspired by the circular screen displays found on\nmodern smart watches.
